# AI Dungeon CLI

This is basically a cli client to [play.aidungeon.io](https://play.aidungeon.io/).

This allows playing AI Dungeon 2 inside a terminal.

I primarily did this to play the game on a DEC VT320 hardware terminal for a more _faithful_ experience.

For more context, read the [accompanying blog post](https://www.eigenbahn.com/2020/02/22/ai-dungeon-cli).

**WARNING:** As of writing the this client [is not working anymore](https://github.com/Eigenbahn/ai-dungeon-cli/issues/29#issuecomment-722294824). This seems to be associated with API changes necessary for the introduction of the stamina system. We'll eventually adapt to those new changes and if you're handy with python you can help speed things up.


## Installation

#### pip

[![PyPI version fury.io](https://badge.fury.io/py/ai-dungeon-cli.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/project/ai-dungeon-cli/)

    $ python3 -m pip install ai-dungeon-cli


Or for unstable release from the source code:

    $ python3 -m pip install .


#### Arch Linux

[![AUR version](https://img.shields.io/aur/version/ai-dungeon-cli?logo=arch-linux)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ai-dungeon-cli)

Package is on [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ai-dungeon-cli-git/).

Using [trizen](https://github.com/trizen/trizen):

    $ trizen -S ai-dungeon-cli-git

Old school way:

    $ git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/ai-dungeon-cli-git.git
    $ cd ai-dungeon-cli-git
    $ makepkg -si


## Playing

Unless specified, all user inputs are considered `Do` actions.

Quoted input entries are automatically interpreted as `Say` actions, e.g.:

    > "Hey dragon! You didn't invite me to the latest BBQ party!"

Do be explicit about the action type, prefix your input with a command:

 - `/do`
 - `/say`
 - `/story`
 - `/remember`

For example, the previous `Say` prompt could also be written:

    > /say Hey dragon! You didn't invite me to the latest BBQ party!

To quit, either press `Ctrl-C`, `Ctrl-D` or type in the special `/quit` command.

## Running

In any case, you first need to create a configuration file.

#### Installed

    $ ai-dungeon-cli

#### From source

With a conda env (assuming you're using [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)):

    $ cd ai-dungeon-cli
    $ conda env create
    $ conda activate ai-dungeon-cli-env
    $ ./ai_dungeon_cli/__init__.py

With a viltualenv:

    $ cd ai-dungeon-cli
    $ virtualenv -p $(command -v python3) ai-dungeon-cli-venv
    $ source ai-dungeon-cli-venv/bin/activate
    $ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ ./ai_dungeon_cli/__init__.py

Please note that all those examples use a virtual env in order to not mess up with the main Python env on your system.


## Configuration (optional)

Several things can be tuned by resorting to a config file.

Create a file `config.yml` either:

 - in the same folder in your home folder: `$HOME/.config/ai-dungeon-cli/config.yml`
 - in the same folder as the sources: `./ai-dungeon-cli/ai_dungeon_cli/config.yml`


#### Authentication

By default, if no authentication configuration is provided, an anonymous session is created.

ai-dungeon-cli supports 2 ways to configure user authentication.

Either precise a couple of credentials in conf:

```yaml
email: '<MY-USER-EMAIL>'
password: '<MY-USER-PASSWORD>'
```

Or sniff a _Authentication Token_ and use it directly:

```yaml
auth_token: '<MY-AUTH-TOKEN>'
```

To get this token, you need to first login in a web browser to [play.aidungeon.io](https://play.aidungeon.io/).

Then you can find the token either in your browser [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) or in the content of the `connection_init` message of the websocket communication (first sent message).

Either way, developer tools (`F12`) is your friend.


#### Slow Typing Animation

By default, responses are printed to the screen instantly.

To enable a fun "slow" typing animation, use:

```yaml
slow_typing_effect: True
```


#### Prompt

The default user prompt is `'> '`.

You can customize it with e.g. :

```yaml
prompt: 'me: '
```


## Command-line arguments

All configuration options are mapped to command-line arguments.

Additionally, some features (such as multi-player support) are only available through those arguments.

The list of all arguments can be retrieved by calling `ai-dungeon-cli` with either `-h` of `--help`.

#### Authentication

One can use either the `--auth-token <token>` or `--email <email> --password <password>` arguments to authenticate.

#### Slow Typing Animation

Just append `--slow-typing` to your execution call to enable this fancy effect.


#### Prompt

The custom prompt can be set with `--prompt '<prompt>'`.


#### Multi-player

To join an existing multi-player adventure, use arguments `--adventure <public-adventure-id> --name <character-name>`.


#### Debug

TO enable debug mode and see the responses from the play.aidungeon.io API, use `--debug`. This option is mainly useful for developers.


## Dependencies

Please have a look at [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt).


## Limitations and future improvements

Right now, the code is over-optimistic: we don't catch cleanly when the backend is down.

A better user experience could be achieved with the use of the [curses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html) library.

For now `/revert` and `/alter`special actions are not supported.

It would also be nice to add support for browsing other players' stories (_Explore_ menu).


## Implementation details

We fallback to a pure ASCII version of the splash logo if we detect an incompatible locale / terminal type.


## Support

As you might have heard, hosting AI Dungeon costs a lot of money.

This cli client relies on the same infrastructure as the online version ([play.aidungeon.io](https://play.aidungeon.io/)).

So don't hesitate to [help support the hosting fees](https://aidungeon.io/) to keep the game up and running.
